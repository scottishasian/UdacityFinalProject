# UdacityFinalProject

## Drinkable App

This app is designed to show a list of cocktails based on a
selected ingredient.

From the list of cocktails, the user can select the cocktail that
interests them and they will be shown instructions on how to make it,
ingredients they will need and their measurements.

### MVP:
* To use the Udacity login API.
* To display a list of cocktails to the user.
* To add new cocktails and persist the data.
* To display information regarding how to make chosen cocktail.
* To use the Open Weather API to show user's weather and help them decide to go out or not.

### To be done at a later date:
* Filter cocktails by selected ingredient.
* To show suggested brands and provide links to their websites.
* To use mapKit to show where a user can find these cocktails.
